# MegaDriveMiniGameRenamer
Simple Python-based script to rename games with any file extension to .bin, for compatibility with Project Lunar

**Warning**
Currently, Project Lunar does not accept .SMD ROM files to be inserted. Please use [SBWin](https://www.zophar.net/utilities/segautil/sbwin.html) to convert the .SMD ROMs to .bin ROMs for compatiblity with Project Lunar.

# What it does
The GameRenamer script/executable goes through a directory and renames the file extension of all files inside of said directory to .bin to let Project Lunar import the games properly.

# How to use
- Put the .py script (or .exe, if you downloaded the executable from the Releases section) in a folder that has another folder with the games in (for example: C:/[folders in between]/[folder where the script is located in]/games).
- Insert the name of the games folder in the command prompt window without quotes (for example: "uncompressed ROMs", "games" etc.).
- The games are renamed in the same folder, so you can import them with Project Lunar.
